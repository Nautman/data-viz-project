The course has been really interesting both in terms of the content we have learned in the course but also about the project that we have done. I believe the group project was efficiently divided and that everybody did a fair share of work with tasks being equally divided. I took a little bit more responsibility in setting up the project technically with the Observable Framework, as well as processing and creating the graph for detailed answers. At the final development stage I also did some polishing.
